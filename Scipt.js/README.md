Lab 1 – Variables and Functions (by-TN)

This js project has helped me demonstrate some of the core JavaScript skills I learned including function creation, variable manipulation, and condition logics. Every taskwas built on the previous one, implementing reusable, structured code with console testing.

In Task 1 I implemented the formatFullName, which formats names as “Last, First” with capitalization checks.
In Task 2 it added calculateTotalCost to compute item totals with tax validation.
In Task 3 checkEligibility, using conditions to determine program qualification.
In Task 4 refactored the total-cost function into a calculateTotalCostV2, adding on a optional discount parameter.

Each function was followed by a console log to verify and test outputs as they are entered. This project uses const and let, and follows clean-code principles for reusability and readability.
